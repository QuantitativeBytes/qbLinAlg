# qbLinAlg
Linear algebra library for C++, created to accompany the corresponding series of videos on the QuantitativeBytes YouTube channel at:

www.youtube.com/c/QuantitativeBytes.

Please note that this code is presented as a "work in progress" meaning that it is not yet complete. It will progress in-line with the videos that I make on the QuantitativeBytes YouTube channel.

Many excellent linear algebra libraries already exist for C++ and as such this code is intended to be primarily for educational purposes, rather than as an alternative to those. It is intended to be studied alongside the corresponding series of videos on the QuantitativeBytes YouTube channel, the full playlist for which can be found here:
